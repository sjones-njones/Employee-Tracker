## Description

This app allows business owner to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company. This is the first time I have used MYSQL. I struggled the most with combining this with Inquirer.       

## Installation 

This app requires Inquirer, Mysql, and console.table to be installed to run properly. The user must run the NPM i command in the console to install the dependencies. 
  
## Usage

### To run this app:
* open terminal
* source the schema.sql and the seed.sql
